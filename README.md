This project includes CAD designs for a custom water cooling box with radiator, pump, and fans. It is intended to cool a 40W hobby laser cutter.

This was created to replace a bucket used for cooling. Open water grew algae, and when the bucket system heated up, only passive radiation could cool it.

This design improves cooling, and is designed using laser-cut plywood, fittings from the hardware store, and commodity PC water cooling parts. It sports variable fan speed, an on/off switch, and a water reservoir. The setup is powered by a computer power supply.


The tolerances are not as tight as they could be, but it works fine.  The panels are held together with M3x16 socket cap screws. The screws are used similar to how they are in the MakerBot design. The side panels are held by friction, but tape can be added to secure them. A future revision might include screws along those edges as well. The tubing is 3/8 ID black vinyl. It's pretty tight inside the box, so correct tubing length is important.


The box is made from 5.5mm Tri-ply from the local big box home improvement store. The enclosure was designed in DraftSight, and cut using my 40W hobby laser. The enclosure is designed to accommodate the following parts (Newegg part numbers):

* 2x Enzotech HF-G1/4-38 Water Cooling Accessory (#N82E16835708034)
* 1x NZXT Sentry-2 5.25" Touch Screen fan controller (#N82E16811992005)
* 1x Swiftech MCP355 12 VDC Pump (#N82E16835108097)
* 1x Rosewill SL-300TFX 300W TFX12V Power Supply - OEM (#N82E16817182207)
* 2x Scythe SY1225SL12SH 120mm "Slipstream" Case Fan (#N82E16835185060)
* 1x Swiftech MCR220-QP Liquid Cooler Radiator (#N82E16835108086)
* 1x Regular GE wall switch
* 1x Radiator assembly fashioned from PVC pipe and brass fittings.

The main power switch closes a circuit between lines 14 and 15 on the ATX power supply connector. This turns the supply on. The coolant loop travels as follows: reservoir-->pump->laser tube->radiator->reservoir. It is important to prime the pump so that it does not self destruct. A drain valve on the pump out line works well for this, if the valve is located below the reservoir.
